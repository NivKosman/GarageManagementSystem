We developed a Garage system.

The system manages 5 types of vehicle: Motorcycle, Electric Motorcycle, Car, Electric Car, Truck.

The Garage provides functionality of: 

*Adding a new vehicle .

*Showing list of license number with option to filter by Their situation in the garage.

*Change the status of a vehicle in the garage.

*Blowing up air in vehicle wheels to maximum by license number
.
*Refueling/Charging a vehicle.

*Showing Complete data of vehicle.


The main goal of thie system is that adding a new type of vehicle (for example:Tractor) can be executed with minimum code change.

This project helped me to practice different elements as:

Several design patterns, Inheritance, Polymorphism and Exceptions.
